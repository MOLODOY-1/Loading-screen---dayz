Hey just want to remind you this a PBO only u can modify it to work with your picture. 
1.Open pbo and copy everything out of there. 
2.Make a copy on your P drive which u can mount thru DAYZ-tools.
3.In Data folder add ur picture and rename it with whatever my picture is and then make sure to remove all files out besides your own picture[make sure that your picture is PNG and 2048x1024.
